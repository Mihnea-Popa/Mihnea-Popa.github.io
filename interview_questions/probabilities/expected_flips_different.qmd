We have a fair coin and we flip it until we find a different outcome from the previous one. What is the expected number of flips that we need to do ?

## 💡 Hint

What is the sequence of the outcomes so that we need n flips ? Also, compute the expectation using power series expansion.

## 💡 Solution

Let's denote by $N$ the total number of flips. The only two outcomes are $H_1, H_2, ..., H_{n-1}, T_n$ (if the first is a head) and $T_1, T_2, ..., T_{n-1}, H_n$ (if the first is a tail). Thus, $\mathbb{P}(N=n) = \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.$

Accordingly, $\mathbb{E}[N] = \sum_{n=2}^{+\infty} \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}.$

By observing that $\frac{d\frac{1}{1-x}-x}{dx} = \frac{d \sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}x^n}{dx}= \sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}nx^{n-1}$ and $\frac{d\frac{1}{1-x}-x}{dx} = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}-1$. By specifying in $\boxed{x=1/2}$, we get $\boxed{\mathbb{E}[N] = \frac{1}{(1/2)^2}-1=3.}$
