You have a fair dice and a loaded dice such that the sum leads to an uniform distribution. `How your dice is fake ?`

## 💡 Solution

We have $X \sim \mathcal{U}\{1,...,6\}$ and $Y$ such that $X +Y \sim \mathcal{U}\{1,...,12\}.$ 

That means that $\forall 1 \le k \le 12, \mathbb{P}(X+Y=k) = 1/12.$ For $k=1$, since the lowest value for X is 1, we know that Y has to be 0. Moreover, $\mathbb{P}(X+Y=1) = \mathbb{P}(X=1)*\mathbb{P}(Y=0)$ so $\boxed{\mathbb{P}(Y=0)=\frac{1/12}{1/6}=1/2.}$ Likewise, since the highest value for X is 6, if X+Y is 12 then Y has to be 6. Thus, $\mathbb{P}(X+Y=12) = \mathbb{P}(X=6)*\mathbb{P}(Y=6)$ so $\boxed{\mathbb{P}(Y=6)=\frac{1/12}{1/6}=1/2.}$

Finally, the faces of the fake dice are `(0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6).`
