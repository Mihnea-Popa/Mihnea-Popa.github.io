Assume that we have $n$ different dices each with $20$ faces. What is `the probability that the sum is even ?`

## 💡 Hint

What is the probability that one dice shows an even number ? Then, for $n$ independant draws ?

## 💡 Solution

Let the final sum be $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ with $\mathbb{P}(X_i=1) = \mathbb{P}(D_i \in 2\mathbb{N}) = 1/2$ and $\mathbb{P}(X_i=0) = \mathbb{P}(D_i \in 2\mathbb{N}+1) = 1/2.$ Therefore, $\boxed{\mathbb{P}(S_n \in 2\mathbb{N}) = \sum_{i \; \text{even}} \binom{n}{i}*2^{-n}= 1/2.}$
