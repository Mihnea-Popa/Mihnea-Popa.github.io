We have `3 fair coins and 1 double-headed coin.` We take one coin randomly, then we flip it and we `get head.` What is the probability that we picked `the double-headed coin ?`

## 💡 Hint

Use Bayes formula $\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}*\mathbb{P}(B|A),$ with the right events.

## 💡 Solution

Let D the event "We have the double-headed coin" and H the event "We drew a head". We want to find $\mathbb{P}(D|H).$

By the Bayes formula we have $$\mathbb{P}(D|H) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(D)*\mathbb{P}(H|D)}{\mathbb{P}(H)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(D)*\mathbb{P}(H|D)}{\mathbb{P}(D)*\mathbb{P}(H|D) + \mathbb{P}(\bar{D})*\mathbb{P}(H|\bar{D})}.$$

Therefore, we get $$\mathbb{P}(D|H) = \frac{\frac{1}{4}*1}{\frac{1}{4}*1 + \frac{3}{4}*\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{5}{8}}=\frac{2}{5}.$$
