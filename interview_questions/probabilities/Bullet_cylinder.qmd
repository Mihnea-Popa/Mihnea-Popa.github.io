A criminal but two bullets in a row in a six bullet cylinder. He shuffles it and shot once, nothing happens. Is it better for you to reshuffle or not ?

## 💡 Solution

Imagine that the bullets are in slot 1 and 2 and that the cylinder goes increasingly, the cycle is therefore (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

* If you reshuffle, every slot is equally plausible and $\mathbb{P}(\text{death | shuffle)} = 1/3$.

* If you don't reshuffle, since the first shot was blank, you know that you are not in slots 1 nor 2. Among the 4 slots left, only the slot 6 would lead to a bullet at the next shot. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\text{death | no shuffle)} = 1/4.$

Thus, `it is better to not reshuffle.`
