Let's suppose that we `paint a cube` on all of its faces. Then we decompose this cube into `27 small cubes. How many small cubes has two faces painted ?`

## 💡 Hint

For every possible number of painted faces, try to count the number of small cubes with that number of painted faces.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## 💡 Solution

One small cube cannot have more that 3 faces painted so we will count how many small cube have 0, 1, 2 and 3 painted faces.

| Number of painted faces | Number of cubes | Explanation |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| 0 | 1 | Center of the original cube |
| 1 | 6 | Center of each face of the original cube |
| 3 | 8 | All the vertices of the original cube |
| 2 | 12 | On the edge of every face but not on the vertices of the cube |
