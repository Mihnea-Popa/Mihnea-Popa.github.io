Let's suppose that we have two ropes and each takes `one hour to burn but not uniformly.` How can we `measure 45 minutes` ?

## 💡 Hint

Try to think about everything that you can do with the ropes and the lighter.

## 💡 Solution

At $t=0 \text{min}$, we burn one end of the first rope and the two ends of the second rope

$$
\begin{aligned}
&🔥 \rule{2cm}{0.4pt} \\
&🔥 \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}🔥
\end{aligned}
$$
After a half-hour, so at $t=30 \text{min}$, the second rope has entirely burned and the first one has a remaining of 30 minutes. At this time, we burn the second end of the first rope.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \rule{0.5cm}{0.01pt}🔥 \rule{1.5cm}{0.4pt}🔥 \\
& \rule{0.5cm}{0.01pt}🔥 \rule{0cm}{0.4pt}🔥
\end{aligned}
$$
Finally, the remaining part of the first rope takes 30 minutes to burn but if we burn at both ends, it only takes 15 minutes. Therefore at $t=45 \text{min}$, the first rope will also be burned entirely.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \rule{1.25cm}{0.01pt}🔥 \rule{0cm}{0.4pt}🔥 \\
& \rule{0.5cm}{0.01pt}🔥  \rule{0cm}{0.4pt}🔥
\end{aligned}
$$
