Imagine that we have 100 coins and among them there are 20 heads. `Create two groups of coins with the same number of heads.`

## 💡 Hint

What can we do with those coins ? We can only regroup them and flip them.

## 💡 Solution

Make a group with 20 coins (k Heads unknown), therefore on the remaining 80 there are 20-k Heads. Now just flip each coin of the first group. Now, both groups have exactly the same number of coins. We can prove this result more generally in the next section.

## 🚨 Generalisation

Let $N$ be the total number of coins and $n$ the number of heads. We will make a group with $m$ coins and try to find the value of m.


| Group 1 | Group 2 | 
|---------------|-------|
| Number coins: m | N - m |
| Number heads: k | n - k |
| Number tails: m-k | N-m-n+k | 

**If we flip the first group**

| Group 1 | Group 2 | 
|---------------|-------|
| Number coins: m | N - m |
| Number heads: m-k | n - k |
| Number tails: k | N-m-n+k | 

We want $m - k = n-k$ thus $\boxed{m=n.}$


**If we flip the second group**

| Group 1 | Group 2 | 
|---------------|-------|
| Number coins: m | N - m |
| Number heads: k | N-m-n+k |
| Number tails: m-k | n-k | 
We want $k=N-m-n+k$ thus $\boxed{m=N-n.}$

Finally, we find the same solution, we just always have to flip the small group (it is logical since if we flip the big group we would have more heads than 20)
