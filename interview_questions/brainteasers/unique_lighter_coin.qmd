Let's suppose that we have `100 coins but one is lighter that the others`. Find the `minimum number of weightings` to identify this fake coin.

## 💡 Hint

Try to think about how many outcomes can one weighting differentiate.

## 💡 Solution

Each weighing can lead to three different outcomes: 

* The left part is heavier
* The left part is lighter
* The left part and the right part have same weight

Now we can find the strategy:

* First weighting : 33 vs 33 (34 left)
* Second weighting: 
  * If one of the groups was lighter: 11 vs 11 (11 left)
  * If same weight: 11 vs 11 (12 left)
* Third weighting:
  * If the second case led to same weight : 4 vs 4 (4 left)
  * If not: 4 vs 4 (3 left)
* Fourth weighting:
  * If the second case led to same weight: 1 vs 1 (1 left) ✅
  * If not : 1 vs 1 (2 left)
* Fifth weighting:
  * If the second case led to different weights: ✅
  * If not : 1 vs 1 (0 left) ✅
  
So the minimum number of weighting to be sure to identify the fake coin in `n = 5`.

## 🚨 Generalisation

We can try to generalise this strategy. Let's assume that there are $N$ coins with one fake. Then since each weighting leads to $3$ different outcomes, we can identify the fake coins with $n$ weightings if $3^n>N$. We want the minimum number of weightings to be sure to identify the coin, thus $$3^{n-1}<N \le 3^n.$$ Accordingly, we have $$n = \lfloor \frac {ln(N)}{ln(3)} \rfloor + 1 .$$
With $N=100$, we find indeed $n=5$.
