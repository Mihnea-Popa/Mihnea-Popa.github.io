Assume we are during the night and four people need to cross a bridge allowing at most two people to cross at the same time and there is only one flashlight. Knowing that there is `one person crossing in 1 minute, one person in 2 minutes, one person in 5 minutes and one person in 10 minutes.` What is your strategy so that everyone crosses the bridge in a `minimum of time ?`

## 💡 Hint

The fastest need to cross together and the slowest need to cross together.

## 💡 Solution

* 1 and 2 cross the bridge (+2 min)
* 1 returns (+1 min)
* 5 and 10 cross the bridge (+10 min)
* 2 returns (+2 min)
* 1 and 2 cross the bridge (+2 min)

Total amount of time `17 minutes.`
