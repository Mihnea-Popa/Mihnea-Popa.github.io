Assume we have a $n\times n$ grid, `how many squares are there ?`

## 💡 Hint

Separate all the squares by their size.

## 💡 Solution


| Size | Number | Explanation
|---------------|-------|-------
| $n\times n$ | 1 | The all grid
| $n-1\times n-1$ | 4 | Leaving one row and one column 2*2 possibilites
| $n-2\times n-2$| 9 | Leaving two rows and two columns 3*3 possibilities
| ...|...|...
|$1\times1$| $n^2$| All little squares

Finally, $N = \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}$
